To-Do:

1:  Create location/knife based revive system.
2:  Detect when all players are frozen to end round and properly score winning team.
3:  Detect if players are frozen
4:  New HP management or display.
5:  Maps 
6:  Ideas
7:  Chat commands?

Methods:

1. when a player is frozen, they could start thinking and check for nearby players who are on the same team every .1 second  
2. make a list of unfrozen players, every time a player is frozen, remove them from the list, when unfrozen, add them back. 
On freeze player function, check for the length of this player list, and end the game if it's 0
3. you can simply add a key on their scope, `player.GetScriptScope().frozen <- true`
4. vscripts
vscript is rather limiting, you cannot hook events and change the resutl like you can in sourcemod. You can try making everyone 
1000 HP and modifying the value manually






Done:
1:  Chat messages and Colors
2:  Freeze Mechanism
3:  Revive base mechanism
4:  Weapon Spawns, give remove weapons.
5:
