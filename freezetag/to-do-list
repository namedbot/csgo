To-Do:

1:  Create location/knife based revive system.
2:  New HP management or display.
3:  Maps 
4:  Ideas
5:  Chat commands?



Methods:

1. when a player is frozen, they could start thinking and check for nearby players who are on the same team every .1 second  
2. vscript is rather limiting, you cannot hook events and change the resutl like you can in sourcemod. You can try making everyone 
1000 HP and modifying the value manually






Done:
1:  Chat messages and Colors
2:  Freeze Mechanism
3:  Revive base mechanism
4:  Weapon Spawns, give remove weapons.
5:  Detect if players are frozen
6:  Detect when all players are frozen to end round and properly score winning team.
